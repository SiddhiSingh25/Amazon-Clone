# Amazon-Clone
This project is a web development project that aims to create a website that looks like the popular e-commerce platform Amazon. The project was created using HTML & CSS. HTML was used to create the structure and content of the web pages, such as the header, footer, navigation bar, etc. CSS was used to style and format the web pages, such as the colors, fonts etc. The website has a responsive and user-friendly design that adapts to different screen sizes and devices. 
This project helped me to practice and improve my skills in web design and development.
